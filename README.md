# Buzzword Therapy

**Buzzword Therapy** is a playful and sarcastic web application dedicated to mocking the overuse of corporate and tech buzzwords across domains like I.T, Management, and Finance.

Born out of frustration after spending too much time scrolling LinkedIn in search of a job (true story), this project was built in around **2 hours** as a light-hearted way to vent, laugh, and ironicallyâ€¦ ship something.

##  Tech Stack

- **React + Vite** (with strict TypeScript)
- **shadcn/ui** â€“ for clean, accessible components
- **TailwindCSS** â€“ for responsive and modern styling
- **React Router DOM** â€“ for navigation
- **PapaParse** â€“ to load CSV-based buzzword data


##  Disclaimer

This project is intended for fun and humor â€“ a satirical take on the language we see daily in tech and business spheres. It's **not** meant to insult, discredit, or offend anyone personally. If anything, we're all part of the buzzword machine. This is just a friendly roast. ðŸ”¥
